Balance Metrics

A basic character should have 1000 life and 3 TP, to start. Because Healing Items and spells are plentiful, an attack should be able to do about 200 damage. Thus, it would take three turns normally to kill a single character. But, of course, things won't work out that well, they'd just heal. So you need to play better equipment to break out better artes, and better items, to power up your character.


So given that, a perfectly average character would have:


HP 1000, TP 3, Att 100, Def 50, Magic 100


Thus...
Base Artes	2 TP		100 pow
Master Artes	3-4 TP		175 pow
Arcane Artes	4-5 TP		250 pow

Novice		3-4 TP		100 pow
Intermediate	5-6 TP		150 pow
Advanced	6-8 TP		200 pow


Which means that equipment should give...
		Min		Max	Att	Def	Mag
HP		50		1500	1200	1500	800
TP		2		15	12	8	15
Att		10		250	250	200	100
Def		10		250	200	250	100
Mag		10		250	0	150	250


Thus, people with high attack can deal high amounts of damage to magic types. People with high defines resist attack types, and people with high magic are great for killing off resistant defensive types.


As a result, TP increasing usables should be

Gels = +2, +5, +8 (costing 1, 3 and 5 to use)
Recipes = +1 to +4


And equipment should be:

Weapons = 0 to 6
Armor = 0 to 1
Accessories = 0 to 5
